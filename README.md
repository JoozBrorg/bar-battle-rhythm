BAR: Battle Rhythm
A Real-Time Coaching Widget for Beyond All Reason

Overview
BAR: Battle Rhythm is a real-time coaching widget for Beyond All Reason designed to help players make stronger strategic decisions throughout a match.

Rather than giving rigid build orders or spammy instructions, Battle Rhythm focuses on decision context, timing, and economic rhythm — helping players understand why certain actions are strong or risky at any given moment.

This project is inspired by “In-Game Coach for Beginners” by uBdead, which provides clear guidance for new players. Battle Rhythm builds on that idea and is intended as a next-step coaching tool for players who want deeper understanding and better mid-to-high level decision-making.

This widget provides guidance only.
It does not automate gameplay — all decisions remain yours.

What Battle Rhythm Does

Battle Rhythm is a live coaching overlay that reacts to the current state of the game and provides guidance around:
Economy flow and stability
Tech timing and transitions
Production tempo and factory usage
Build priorities and infrastructure scaling
Converting economic advantage into pressure
The goal is not to tell you what to do, but to help you recognize when something is appropriate and why it matters.


How It Differs from “In-Game Coach for Beginners”
“In-Game Coach for Beginners” focuses on direct, beginner-friendly prompts such as expanding economy or adding energy.

Battle Rhythm focuses on context-aware decision guidance, including:
Uses net economy (income vs spend) instead of raw resource bar levels
Correct handling of Energy → Metal conversion
Differentiates true stalls from normal project drain (AFUS, fusion, tech builds)
Detects and reacts to game phases:
Opening
T2 Spike
Tech Stress
Pressure Phase
T3 Endgame
Understands when teching is safe vs risky
Stops suggesting tech once that tech is already online

Tempo-based production guidance:
Detects idle factories
Identifies low-queue or single-unit playstyles
Only prompts when economy can support increased output
Pressure guidance:
Detects economic dominance
Encourages converting advantage into units and map control
Current Features
Battle Rhythm currently includes:
Early-game production and economy guidance

Live recommendations for when to:
Build T1, T2, and T3 factories
Upgrade metal extractors using T2 constructors
Add converters, power generation, or build power
Contextual explanations for:
Tech stress
Project stress (AFUS, fusion, large infrastructure builds)
Real stalls versus intentional spending
A live, adaptive to-do list that updates as the game progresses
Planned / Upcoming Improvements

The following features and refinements are planned for future updates:
Army presence and tech safety guidance
Improved detection of expansion versus turtling
Clearer post-T3 and late-game priorities

More faction-aware guidance:
Arm
Core
Legion

The widget currently supports all factions.
Faction-specific tuning and deeper faction awareness will be expanded in future updates.
